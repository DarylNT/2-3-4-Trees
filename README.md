# 2-3-4 Trees

A 2-3-4 tree is a type of data structure whose nodes can store 2, 3, or 4 children. The nodes themselves can store 1, 2, or 3 values. For more information look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933%E2%80%934_tree

## Functions
Major functions:
- addValue
- hasValue
- deleteValue
- printInOrder

All other functions are either helpers to the main functions or methods within the node class that help define nodes


## Future Updates
I wasnt allowed to post the schools judge code, so if I have the time I will make my own. Will have to come much later though
